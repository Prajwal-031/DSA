# 🚀 Quick Start Guide

## Welcome to Your DSA Interview Preparation!

This repository is structured to take you from **basic to advanced** DSA concepts, specifically designed for **MNC interviews**.

---

## 📍 Where to Start?

### **Step 1: Read the Main README**
- Understand the learning path
- Learn about Python vs Java for interviews
- Get familiar with the structure

### **Step 2: Start with Arrays** ✅ (Current Topic)
Navigate to: `01_Arrays/`

**Recommended Order:**
1. Read `01_Arrays/README.md` - Understand concepts
2. Study `01_Arrays/python/01_basics.py` - Learn basic operations
3. Solve problems:
   - `02_two_sum.py` - Classic interview problem
   - `03_maximum_subarray.py` - Kadane's Algorithm
   - `04_rotate_array.py` - In-place operations
   - `05_product_except_self.py` - Prefix/Postfix pattern
4. Practice more from `PRACTICE_PROBLEMS.md`

### **Step 3: Practice Daily**
- Solve 2-3 problems per day
- Code in both Python and Java
- Focus on understanding patterns, not memorizing

---

## 💻 How to Run Code

### **Python:**
```bash
cd 01_Arrays/python
python 01_basics.py
python 02_two_sum.py
```

### **Java:**
```bash
cd 01_Arrays/java
javac ArrayBasics.java
java ArrayBasics
```

## 🎯 Current Status

✅ **Completed:**
- Main README with learning path
- Arrays topic (basic to advanced)
- 5 core array problems (Python + Java)
- Practice problems guide

📚 **Next Topics:**
- Strings
- Linked Lists
- Stacks & Queues
- Trees
- Graphs
- And more...

---

## 📝 Study Tips

1. **Code Along**: Don't just read, type the code yourself
2. **Explain Out Loud**: Practice explaining your approach (like in interviews)
3. **Time Yourself**: Easy (15 min), Medium (30 min), Hard (45 min)
4. **Review Patterns**: Focus on recognizing patterns, not memorizing solutions
5. **Both Languages**: Practice in Python (primary) and Java (secondary)

---

## 🎓 Interview Strategy

### **Problem-Solving Framework:**
1. **Understand** - Read problem, ask questions
2. **Examples** - Work through 2-3 examples manually
3. **Approach** - Discuss brute force → optimize
4. **Code** - Write clean, readable code
5. **Test** - Walk through with examples
6. **Optimize** - Discuss time/space complexity

### **Language Choice:**
- **Primary**: Python (faster, cleaner, widely accepted)
- **Secondary**: Java (for companies that prefer it)
