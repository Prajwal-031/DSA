# DSA Learning Path for MNC Interviews 🚀

## 📊 Language Choice: Python vs Java (2024 Market Trends)

### **Python - RECOMMENDED for Interviews** ✅

**Advantages:**
- **Faster to write**: Less boilerplate code = more time for problem-solving
- **Readable syntax**: Easier to explain logic to interviewers
- **Industry preference**: 70%+ of tech companies (Google, Meta, Amazon) accept Python
- **Rapid prototyping**: Quick to test ideas during interviews
- **Growing demand**: Python developers are highly sought after

**Best for:**
- FAANG companies (Facebook/Meta, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google)
- Startups and tech companies
- Data science and ML roles
- Quick problem-solving in interviews

### **Java - Strong Enterprise Choice** 💼

**Advantages:**
- **Enterprise standard**: Still dominant in large-scale systems
- **Type safety**: Compile-time error checking
- **Performance**: Better for system-level programming
- **Industry presence**: Many MNCs use Java in production

**Best for:**
- Enterprise software companies
- Banking and financial services
- System design roles
- Companies with Java tech stack

### **Recommendation for Interviews:**
**Start with Python** - It's faster to code, easier to debug, and widely accepted. Learn Java as a secondary language for companies that prefer it.

## 🎯 Interview Strategy

### **Problem-Solving Framework:**
1. **Understand** - Read problem carefully, ask clarifying questions
2. **Examples** - Work through 2-3 examples manually
3. **Approach** - Discuss brute force, then optimize
4. **Code** - Write clean, readable code
5. **Test** - Walk through with examples
6. **Optimize** - Discuss time/space complexity

### **Time Complexity Goals:**
- Easy: O(n) or O(n log n)
- Medium: O(n) or O(n²) with optimization
- Hard: O(n log n) or better
