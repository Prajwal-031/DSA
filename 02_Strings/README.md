# Strings - Complete Guide for Interviews

## 📖 What is Strings?

A string is a sequence of characters. In most programming languages, strings are immutable.

### Key Characteristics:
- Immutable in Python and Java
- Zero-based indexing
- Can be treated as array of characters
- Common operations: concatenation, substring, search

---

## 🎯 Core Concepts

### 1. **Basic Operations**

- Length, indexing, slicing
- Concatenation and comparison
- Search and replace

### 2. **Time Complexities**

| Operation | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
|-----------|----------------|------------------|
| Access by index | O(1) | O(1) |
| Substring | O(n) | O(n) |
| Search | O(n) | O(1) |

### 3. **Common Patterns**

1. Two Pointers
2. Sliding Window
3. Character Frequency
4. String Manipulation
